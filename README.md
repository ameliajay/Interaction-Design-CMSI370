# Interaction-Design-CMSI370
*Loyola Marymount University Interaction Design class projects from Fall 2018*

## Front End Design
The aim of this first project was to design a web app using knowledge of design principles and usability metrics. These metrics include learnability (how fast a person can learn how to use the app), memorability (how fast a person can navigate the web app after not seeing it for a long period of time), efficiency (how many different actions a person has to do to complete a certain function), error (how often a person takes a certain action expecting a different outcome than what happens), and satisfiability (how satisfied a person is with using the web app). The web app I designed was a simple task manager. In *front-end-design.md* I have included a write up about why I chose to design my app the way I did, and there are several annotated mockups that show how the web app should look and function.
