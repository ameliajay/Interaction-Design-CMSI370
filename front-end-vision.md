# Front End Design Vision

My design vision for my task manager is similar to what I had envisioned for this assignment, with a few added features. I think it would be very beneficial for the user if they could drag the lists and tasks around as to have the order they want to see them in. Personally, I like my tasks to be in order of priority, not necessarily the order that I created them in. I would also like my task manager to be unique and be something that people want to use over other similar applications. Two features that I believe would help it stand out would be customizability and a shared list feature. By customizability, I mean that there would be a settings screen where you can choose the background color, and the title of your task manager, as well as the color of each list card. From a design standpoint, how the task manager looks is partially the user's doing. If the user doesn't like choosing colors for each list etc. they could choose from a couple different themes that set up colors for them. However, for the users who do like to be more hands on in customizing their task manager, they can, which is super exciting. The second added feature to set my application apart from others is the shared list feature. If someone wants to share a list or a specific task with a friend, there would be an option to share lists. There would be a shared list page where you can edit a list and anyone who also has that list would see your edits. If you edit the list on your own account though, the edits would not be shown to others unless you want them to (there would be a button saying "share edits" if it is a shared list).

## Top-Level Design/Layout
The image below is the home screen, and it lists all of the tasklists the user has. The "My Lists" button in the top right corner is present on every screen of the application, and by clicking it the user will always be take back to this screen. In the top left corner are the settings button and the shared list/task screen button. By dragging the tasklist cards across the screen you can switch the places of the lists on the screen. They will always appear in the same format but the user can choose the order that they are displayed in.

The image below is the list screen. It displays all the tasks in the list that was selected. You can edit the list name from this screen, share the list with your friends, or delete the list. You can also check off your task by clicking the checkbox or drag the tasks up and down to change the order that the tasks are displayed in. To see further details or edit the task you've created, you can click the details button that appears on the same line as the task you want to view.

The image below is the task screen. It displays the details of the selected task. You can edit the name of the task, share the task, or delete the task by clicking the icons on the right of the task name. You can input a date and time that you want the task to be completed by as well as add notes about the task. These notes are supposed to be really easy for the user to understand when they look back at them, so there are options to write in italic, bold, or underlined font as well as add bullet points.

The image below is the sharing screen. By clicking the "sharing" icon in the upper left corner of the screen (represented by two little people) you are taken to the sharing screen. This screen displays all of your shared lists and tasks. Lists are on the left half of the screen and tasks are on the right. In the upper right corner of the tasklists and tasks are the names of the people sharing those lists/tasks. To view a list or task or to edit them, the user does the exact same thing as they would with the lists and tasks that are not shared. On the right side of the screen there is a "Friends" section. This section can be hidden or displayed by clicking the small arrow on the bar that separates it from the shared tasks section. The "Friends" section lists all of your friends who use the task manager application. To add a friend, you click the "Add Friend" button and type in their username to connect. When you are working on a list or task and decide you want to share it, you can share it with any of the friends listed in that section.

My task manager vision is similar to what I have already created, but it has more features and is more functional in general. The customizability makes it more fun to use in my opinion, which is definitely a plus from a user standpoint.

## Usage Scenarios

### Writing Tasks for a Group Project
This task manager application would work super well for organizing the preparation for a group project and making sure all tasks get checked off. One group member would create a new list by clicking the "New List" button on the home screen. That person would then click on "View Tasks". On the list screen they would then click the sharing icon and select the other group members. Now this list would be shared by all group members so that they could all access it. To edit the list and add tasks, the user simply clicks on "New Task". To edit the details of the new task the user clicks on "Details" which takes the user to the task screen where they can write notes about that task. One of the tasks for the group project could be a presentation. The notes about the presentation could talk about who is speaking on which topic and how long the presentation must be. The date of the presentation can also be specified on the task screen. Since the list is shared, any group members can see the details about their project from their task manager.

### Completing a Task on a Shared List
This task manager could also function well as a group grocery list for a group of people that live together. The list could be shared with all of the house members. Once an item from the list has been bought, the person who bought it can check off the checkbox next to that item's name. This way other people do not get any more of it when they go to the store. The person who bought the item could also click the "Details" button and edit the notes to let everyone else know who just bought that item and how much it was if they want to be paid back.

## Design Rationale
The priorities for my design are as follows:
1. It is important for the web application to look good so that people want to look at it and want to use.
2. The task manager must be easy to use and easy to learn how to use so that people want to start using it.
3. There are other task managers out there, so this one must be unique and stand out with its extra features.

Adding customizability and the sharing feature are two ways this task manager would stand out. The design of my task manager is very aesthetically pleasing because it is simple and visually consistent throughout the different screens. The consistency of the app would make it easy to use as well. The use of familiar icons (like a gear to represent settings and a pencil to represent edit) make it easy to use and learn how to use as well.

## Usability Metric Motivation
1. *Learnability:* My new vision for the task manager should fare pretty well when it comes to learnability. All of the screens are still very intuitive and the buttons make it clear where to click for different things. The sharing feature of the web application is something that could be harder to learn because it isn't done that often when it comes to tasklists. However, it should behave similarly to the Google Docs sharing feature which many people are familiar with.
2. *Efficiency:* My ideal task manager would be quite efficient once the user figures out how all the features work. The process of creating a new list or task takes the click of one button, and to add details about that is just one more click. The sharing screen is especially simple because all the lists and tasks are in one place which makes use of it very efficient.
3. *Errors:* Since the settings button, sharing screen button, edit button, and delete button are represented by icons which do give room to error if you don't recognize right away what they represent. However, by clicking on them just once, it is pretty easy to remember what they each do. I changed the "Home" button to say "My Lists" so it better describes the page you are going to. That takes away from possible error if people don't understand where "Home" will take them.
4. *Memorability:* This task manager is extremely memorable. Once you know how to use it, the buttons and icons should all be familiar and will make it easy to remember how everything works. The consistency of how the information on each screen is shown helps people remember how the application works as well.
5. *Satisfaction:* The customizability of this task manager is something that will be a really positive factor in the satisfaction of application. When a user gets to make something their own, they feel more attached to it and more excited to use it. The functionality of the task manager would ideally be much better than the one I created already, which definitely adds to satisfaction. When a product works well, it is something people will keep coming back to.
